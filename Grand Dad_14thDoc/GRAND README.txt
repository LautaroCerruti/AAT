Thank you for downloading Grand Dad made by The 14th Doctor & Tiniest Turtles.

What this Grand Dad aims to do is to be based on his appearance from the Grand Dad fan game made by Red-Fire, in which, Tiniest Turtles helped with, and because of that, he features a few moves that are based on weapons he can use in that game, with a few random moves thrown in to made him even more Grand. Anyway, let's get into his Grand moveset, shall we?
